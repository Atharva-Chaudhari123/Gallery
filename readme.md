Hey there , This Repo containes another simple project of css
of my web dev series 
In this project,
	I have created an image Gallery in which I have used Css concepts like CSS grids 
	initially the gallery appears totally b/w but when you hover onto the image it scales a bit with a very smooth transition
	and turns colerful

	gallery.html - source code
	gallerys.css - css file
	output.mp4 - Video output of the program
	Gallery folder - Images used in the source code
